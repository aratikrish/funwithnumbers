Given my love for organizing, what better way to start this blog than with a post about [Janitor](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor), the R package to clean dirty data ! Janitor helps clean up data frame column names and provide other tools to examine and clean data frames. Per the documentation it also helps create frequency tables for variables, though I have not used that functionality.

1.  I imported an excel file and the resulting data frame has horrendous columns! how do i clean them?

    There was a time decades ago when I would write lines of code to do this. (Janitor has been around almost 8 years now). Now, I use janitor::clean_names()

2.  The excel file has column headings in row 11. The rows above contain data that I need.

    Use janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 11, remove_rows_above = FALSE) - This will elevate row 11 to be the header, ie be the column names

3.  Finding the row with header names - searching for the first non null row or looking for a row iwth a specific value in the first column

    janitor::find_header()

4.  How about those annoying blank rows that need to be removed?

    janitor::remove_empty(which = "rows")

5.  How do you compare dataframe columns before doing a bind_rows

    janitor::compare_df_cols()

6.  Count and percentage of combinations of one , two and three variables

    janitor::tabyl() with adorn\*

7.  Check for rows with duplicated values of specific combination of variables

    janitor::get_dupes(column1, column2)

8.  Drop columns with a constant value

    janitor::remove_constant()

9.  Rounding behavior as expected (base R uses banker's rounding)

    janitor::round_half_up()

10. Fix dates stored as serial numbers in excel (!)

    janitor::excel_numeric_to_date() or better still -

    janitor::convert_to_date() - this is more robust with a mix of inputs, so helpful when you have a column from excel that has dates in multiple formats, including as a serial number.

Other functions that I have not explored yet:

-   get_one_to_one()

-   make_clean_names()

-   single_value()

-   round_to_fraction()

-   top_levels()

Such a great package!
