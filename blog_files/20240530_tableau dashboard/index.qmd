Ever been in a situation where you have multiple charts and other objects on a Tableau dashboard and you'd like to change the format of all of their titles so it all fits a little better and looks cleaner?

I have been there multiple times.

And am yet to figure out a way to update all the titles at the same time, without having to edit each title separately.

I figured I could use Dashboard -\> Format

and then use the "Worksheet Titles" and "Text Objects" to change the font of all the titles in one shot. But no, did not work - Here for example, I chose Calibri, 8pt, orange for Worksheet Titles, but they all remained what they were. Changing the "shading" seems to change it on the worksheets though.

For "Text Objects" changing size works but changing color or font type does not.

And I see no way to change the format of axis labels all at once.

So it seems like the only way would be to manually change each chart one at a time? sigh...

UPDATE:

I THINK I FOUND A SOLUTION (AFTER ANOTHER 30MINS OF GOOGLING) !!!

Going to Format -\> Workbook and altering the settings on there seems to do the trick! So my conclusion is that Tableau does not recognize these worksheets as dashboard objects, hence the Format -\> Dashboard or Dashboard -\> Format does not change anything. But changing overall workbook options makes changes in every worksheet.
