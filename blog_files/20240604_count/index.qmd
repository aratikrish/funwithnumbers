A short post about dplyr::count() - a handy alternative to group_by() and summarize(n = n()). Has a .sort argument that defaults to FALSE and a .drop argument that defaults to FALSE.

```{r}
#| eval: false

sampledf |>
  count(data_source, item_tracer_category)

# To sort by the count, use this:

sampledf |>
  count(data_source, item_tracer_category, sort = TRUE)

# To sort by the variable names first and then by the count, go back to using arrange:

sampledf |>
  count(data_source, item_tracer_category) |> 
  arrange(data_source, item_tracer_category, desc(n))

```
